# DobotProject
This was one of my senior projects that involved networking with a DOBOT Magician Robotic arm. The program was designed to connect to a Google Drive folder, check for a new PNG image, and give the DOBOT instructions to draw the image.

Going forward, the project will be improved by adding a component that converts images into xyz coordinated for the DOBOT to follow. At the moment, all coodinates are hard coded for project presentation purposes.
